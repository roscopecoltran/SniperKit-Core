# DAT234

This repository contains the files for the course DAT234, Hacking & Scripting

The file(s) for each task are separated into their respective folders.

To run the scripts, enter their folder and type e.g. `./task4.bash`

The solutions I've made for Task 4 and Task 5 include one script using fping to ping the hosts, and one using nmap to achieve the same goal.

All files in the task4 and task5 folders can be run either directly with `./task4.bash` (or `./task4nmap.bash`) or by giving the input upon running the script by typing `echo "192.168.56.1" | ./task4.bash`
