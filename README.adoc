This repository represents a work in progress rewrite of the SP protocol
library called "libnanomsg".  The work is being done by Garrett D'Amore,
and at this juncture he is not yet soliciting implementation assistance;
that said if you want to help with this project please file an issue
with details about what you'd like to do, and you will be contacted.

Review and testing feedback are appreciated however; but please understand
that the project is still quite preliminary.

This is a work in progress, and is *not* for suitable for product use or
publication.  When the library is ready for broader consumption, an
announcement will be posted on the nanomsg mailing list and website.

If you are looking for the current production version of nanomsg, please
see the https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg site.

If you want to build and test yourself, you need CMake version 3.1, and
you can use standard CMake build recipes.  On a Linux/UNIX system, 
you can for example do:

----
  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make test
----

The API is not yet stable, but if you want to explore using the newer
API, pleaes have a look at the `nng.h` header file.  A legacy compatible
`nng_compat.h` header is available and offers API compatibility with legacy
_nanomsg_.
